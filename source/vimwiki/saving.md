## Reason to save
* **Consumption smoothing:** Instead of spending all your money right now, save for the future use
* For special events that are predictable
* Enough money to take advantage of **opportunities**: Open business, buy home, land, ...

## Reason not to save
* High inflation
* Having a lot of money now and you are expected to have more in the future
* Better financial situation in the future (consumption smoothing)
* **Don't save if you expect your income to grow a lot**

> **Saving is all about smooth consumption, if it's not then don't save**

## How could the poor save
* There's nothing to do with being poor. **_Saving is all about having a balance today and tomorrow spending_**
* The poor won't save if they are starving or cold

### The poor have limited access to bank account. Why
* **Facility**: poor area have a much worse infrastructure 
* **Small deposit,** which means the profit of the bank is less than the fixed banking cost
* _Why the banking cost is fixed:_
    * **Every deposit has be recorded** in proper way. 5$ or 100000$ will have to be recorded in the same way (which make 5$ cost a lot)

### Disadvantages of saving at home
* **Inflation**
* **Crime** (stealing, ...) so you have to protect the money by yourself. You don't have to do this you send your money to a bank
* Self-control and spouse-control
    * Self-control: I can spend money on my own interest
    * **Spouse-control:** Maybe they need some money, someone asks for your money, so don't keep it at home

## ROSCAs
### What is 
Rotating savings and credit association (ROSCAs) is a group where everyone decide to give a fixed amount of money to the group overtime and borrow from it 

### Type of ROSCAs

**Fixed**

* This is easier to define through an example :D
* **Ex:** Let's say there are 10 people. Each day, everyone puts in 10$ so there is 100$ each day. One the first day, person 1 gets all. By the second day, person 2 gets all and so on
* _Advantages_
    * If I need 100$, I can **get the money now** and pay for the next few days instead of saving for 10 days
    * It's faster for over all. In the best case, you are the first. In the worst case, you are the last but it took the same time as saving on your own

**Bidding** 

* Instead of having a fixed order, people pay more to be the first one. Say you pay 60 to get 50 first and the other pay 55 to get 50 second
* _Advantages_
    * You can get money faster. Similar to a bank

### Disadvantages
* **Inflexible** only save a fixed amount of money
* **Short-term** this is not for long term saving

## Brick by brick saving method
### What is
Kind of **buying unfinished house** and wait for their price to go up in the future

### Pros
* _Long-term_ investment
* Fairly _stable_ as a lot of people will buy a house
* _Easier to keep than gold._ If you buy gold, you have to keep it secret so no one would steal it. On the other hand, houses are legalised by a lot of papers which will ensure no one can steal them
* More _useful_ than gold. You can live in a house but not in gold :v

### Cons
* _Things can happened,_ it may not be finished and abandoned
* _The price may be drop,_ economic crises can strike and shit things up

### Self-help group (similar to ROSCAs and banks)
More _flexible_ then ROSCAs people can lend or borrow a flexible amount of money they want
**Require some accountant** to keep track of every transitions (Very important)

### Microcredit
Some one force me to pay instead of saving on my own

_liquid and illiquid asset_

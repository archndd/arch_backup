# Link between social connection and happiness
* Social relationship doesn't guarantee a happy life but without it you can't be happy
    _Social relationship is like the necessary condition_ but you also need sufficient condition as well
* Loneliness is not good for physical and mental health
Research shows that people with bigger friend pool tend to be happier. But it depends on your **personality**, bigger doesn't always guarantee better.

# To be a happy adult you need 
Social connection or academic achievement and so much more

# Why
Caretaking: offspring, people in need
Reconcile forgiving instead of leaving 
Coordination: imitate other emotion

# Attachment
Family has a huge effect on attachment style
Attachment style:
    * Secure: feel safe, being close is easy (mostly happier)
    * Anxious fear their partners don't love them or don't want to be with them (prone to depression, anxiety): exaggerate negative feelings (I think I might have a anxious attachment with my first love)
    * Avoidant cold and heartless: response less to positive emotions

# How to overcome insecure attachment
Emotional care is good for both secure and anxious one. However, more rational discussion will be better for avoidant one
Find someone who has secure attachment style. If you fall in love with insecure one, find a therapist to help you feel more secure.

## A philosophical question
* If you have button that will make you feel happy instantly whenever you press it, would you press that button? Why and why not?

> I would not press that button. To me, happiness is the process not the result. Happiness must have some sort of meaning to it or else it's just pleasure or indulgence. What is the point of being happy all the time if there is no appreciation of the effort, the time you spend, the work you put into finding happiness.

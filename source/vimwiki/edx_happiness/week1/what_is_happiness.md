## How I define happiness
**To me, happiness is when I solve a hard problem, when I learn something interesting and feel that I am growing up every single day and tomorrow me is a better version of now me. It's a moment when I step back and feel fortune with all I have, what I have been through with a smile on my mouth.**

## How Scientists Define and Measure Happiness
**Daniel Kahneman**: What it's mean when one said they are happy
* _Well-being:_ life is good
* _Trait_: enthusiastic 
* _Emotion_: joy
* _Sensations_: feels good

## Measure of Happiness
* _Self-report:_ Satisfaction with life-scale, scale of positive and negative emotion
* _Experience sampling_: Overtime report e.g. every hour 
* _Expressive behavior_: Indicator of happiness using body expression e.g. face muscle tension 

## Modern day philosophy on happiness:
* It's both _feeling good_, content and _make people surround feel happy_.
* It's something people _can pursuit_ instead of luckily have it.
    * This leads to _unhappiness of not being happy_. And it makes everything worse
    * To cure this condition, we might **focus less on our own personal happiness and instead on the happiness of those around us**, for relentless focus on one’s own happiness has the potential to be self-defeating.

## Happy Life and Meaningful Life
Meaningful life and a happy life often go hand-in-hand but not always. There are still some differences.

### Five differences between ***happy life*** and **Meaningful life**
* Happy people ***satisfy their wants and needs***, but that seems **largely irrelevant** to a meaningful life.
* Happiness involves being focused on the ***present***, whereas meaningfulness involves thinking more about the **past, present, and future—and the relationship between them.**
* Meaningfulness is derived from **giving to other people**; happiness comes from ***what they give*** to you.
* Meaningful lives **involve stress and challenges**. Happiness ***usually don't***.
* **Self-expression** is important to meaning but ***not happiness***.

Meaningful is more about **giving** while happiness is more about ***taking***. But they both have associated effects on each other.
So seek for both, you can't just have one.

## Misconception about happiness 
* Satisfied every moment
* Never have negative feeling
* One solution to all unhappiness situations

> Happiness is not about feeling positive. Too much positive can even harm you. 

### Four Ways Happiness Can Hurt You
* _Too much happiness_ can make you less creative—and less safe.
    Happiness is best when experienced in moderation-not too little, not too much
* Happiness is _not suited to every situation_.
* _Not all types of happiness are good_ for you.
    Certain kinds of happiness (such as too much pride) may at times hinder our ability to connect with those around us.
* _Pursuing happiness may actually make you unhappy_.
    I think it's true, I can feel it

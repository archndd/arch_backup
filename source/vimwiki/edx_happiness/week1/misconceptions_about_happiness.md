## Some pessimism about happiness
* It's _in our genes_, some people are born to be happier
* Happiness is _more like a trait_, and trait is a long-term characteristic of a person so it's hard to change
* We _adapt_ to positive situation very fast, this makes things no longer as happy as before

### Obstacles 
* _Hedonic adaptation_
* _We poorly judge_ what bring us happiness and how long it will last. For example, we think that we will be sad for a long time after breakup but in fact we will be as happy as we are now.
* _Impact bias_: we tend to overestimate the affect of negative and positive event to our happiness.
* _Assets and happiness don't linear correlation_. At certain point, having more assets doesn't bring more happiness.

### Money and happiness
* Money affect us at _cultural level_
* Poor people tend to be happier when they receive money. Because they can have a much better living condition.
* _It matters but it's not everything_

## So what can make us happy 
* Exercise (I should do some)
* Sleep: having a good sleep is one aspects of being happy
* Sense of achievement
* Social connection and kindness

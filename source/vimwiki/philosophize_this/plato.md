* Theory of form. To Plato, everything has a true ultimate form, for example, the true tree, true dog, ... Every object is just a rip off version of it. I don't think tangible object has this ultimate form but I do believe that concepts like beauty, justice, braveness actually do. The only way to get closer to that true form is through reasoning and thinking.
* The act we see as justice or the appearance we see as beautiful could not be true. The concept of beauty and the things we see as beautiful is not the same and we misconstrue them. The way to overcome this is through reasoning, of course, like Socrates. So that we can finally see what is pretty and what is ugly beyond the appearances, to really the inner beauty of personality.

* To Aristotle, the ultimate end goal of life is to live well. Everything we do is either an end or a means to an end. We cannot explain why we want happiness so it's the end goal here.
* Your desire does not really have to do good for you like a big chips, snake, junk food. We define real good which is desire that is good for you. So to have a good life, you need to fulfill your natural desire (eat, sleep, ...) aka need and achieve some of your desire aka want and we also need a path to reach the real good which are different from person to person.
* Knowledge is another factor of living well. You need to be recognized by others for your skills or your intellectual ability. To do so, you need knowledge
* Even though there are several basic good, but it has to be in temperance. For example, not eating too much food or having too much sleep.
* There are other things as well to live well. These are habit, courage, luck and justice. People are success because of what they do every day. Courage in this sense is doing things that cause pain for a greater good like going to the gym, learning new stuff,... Luck, sometimes you need luck, to have a shelter and enough food, to be in a good neighbor. Justice, we live in a society, if one gets better because of their bad behaviors, you cannot feel good, so we need a well-made, equal law for keep justice.

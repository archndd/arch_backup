### Core idea
* We, human beings, are a species that's not only capable of acting on **hidden motives - we're designed to do it**
* Our brains are built to **act in our self-interest** while at the same time **trying hard not to appear selfish** in front of other people
* _The less we know of our own ugly motives, the easier it is to hide them from others_. **Self-deception** is therefore strategic, **a ploy our brains use to look good while behaving badly**
* **Approach by evolutionary psychology**, by looking from Darwinian perspective. Then looking at larger social levels.
* For more information: There's a Standford's course called Behavior Biology, which suggest the idea that all of our behavior deprived from our motives to pass our genes to our future generations

### Notation
* **"The elephant": refer to the ugly motives of ourselves**. Like the fact that we’re competitive social animals _fighting for power, status, and sex_; the fact that we’re sometimes _willing to lie and cheat to get ahead_; the fact that _we hide some of our motives_

## Why We Hide Our Motives
1. Animal Behavior
    * In some primates, ones help others to _build trust between them and expect to be helped in return_.
    * **Some species have altruistic behavior because of their own goods instead of "good for the species"**. They will have higher chance of surviving and reproducing their genes
2. Competition
    * _It is suggested that humans developed big brain because of the intra-species competition_. **We will lie to get the better of others while trying to detect lies.** That's why we need bigger brain to process more information.
    * Sex: **One of the reason why we compete is to reproduce our genes**. Like peacocks having heavy and colorful tails for the sake of reproduction but not survival.
    * Social status: **There are dominance and prestigious**. Though prestigious is not as competitive as dominance, _they are zero-sum game which explains why we sometimes envy of our close friend's success._
    * Politic: **The ability to gang up and fighting others to achieve high status**. Politic is the combination of betrayal, violence, backstabbing and wisdom, kind, charisma.
    * Each game requires two complementary skill sets: **the ability to evaluate potential partners** and **the ability to attract good partners**
        > Judge freely, and accept that you too will be judged.  

3. Norm
    * **Norms help us decide** what to do in a certain situation (fight or flight)
    * **Collective enforcement**, _the fear of the denial of a group_, is what keep norms in place.
    * **Weapons** plays an important role in this scenario. They **enable the weak to beat on the strong** without heavy injury.
    * **Gossiping** (sometimes to keep people from behaving badly) and Getting **reputation** from standing up to cheaters are two very important aspects to keeps things in order.
4. Cheating
    * It's our **fear of shame** that prompts us either _to refrain from cheating_, or _else to cover our tracks so others don't find out_.
    * _There are two dimensions to keeping a secret_: **how widely** it's known and **how openly** or commonly it's known
        * A secret _can be widely known_ without being openly known like the fact that the emperor is naked, everyone knows but they know if others have the same thought as theirs.
        * Some secrets need to be kept unfound. _What matters is how openly it's known_. Like if you cheat, the only things matter is whether the professor knows it or not even though other students know.
    * _Norm enforcement requires not only_ **detecting a norm violation** but also **prosecuting the violation**.
    * There are **four main forms** of cheating:
        * _Pretexts_ (excuses) make prosecution more difficult. A pretext doesn't need to fool everyone, it simply needs to be plausible enough to make people worry that other people might believe it.
        * _Discreet communication_ to get away with something by preventing the message from becoming common knowledge.
        * _Skirting_ norms because real norms have many gray areas. Thus, some will try to take advantage of this.
        * _Minor sins_. **We’re selfish**. Not irredeemably selfish, **just slightly more** than our highest standards of behavior demand. We cloak our actions in justifications that appeal to what's best for everyone though these actions benefit us.
    *  If norms are supposed to discourage competition, then why do we still need big brains? A plausible answer is that **our norms are only partially enforced, so we need big brains to figure out how to cheat**.
5. Self-deception
    * We often **deceive ourselves** into _thinking_ we are **in a better situation** in what we are really in
    * There _2 schools of thought_ on why we cheat our mind:
        * Self-deception as **a defense mechanism**, to _protect our self-esteem_. The question now is why nature builds this? This mechanism can put us into misinterpreting the situation, which can lead to a very bad consequence.
        * Self-deception as **manipulation**:
            * The value lies in **convincing other players that you've sabotaged yourself**
            * **The entire value** of strategic ignorance and related phenomena lies **in the way others act when they believe that you’re ignorant**
    * So why we deceive ourselves instead of knowing the truth and cheat others?
        * Because **lying is hard**. It _demands a lot of brain power_ to lie. We also _fear of being known lying_ to others.
        * Therefore, a good way to cope with this is to lie ourselves.
    * Self-deception in practice (4 ways):
        * **The Madman**: When we _commit ourselves_ to a particular course of action, it often changes the incentives for other players
        * **The Loyalist**: "_Sure, I’ll go along with your beliefs,_" says the Loyalist, thereby demonstrating commitment and _hoping to earn trust in return_
            * It only demonstrates loyalty to believe something that we wouldn't have reason to believe unless we were loyal.
            * _The truth is a poor litmus test of loyalty_.
        * **The Cheerleader**: "I know this is true," the Cheerleader says. "Come on, believe it with me!"
            * It's _easier to persuade others if we also believe in it._
        * **The Cheater**: "I have no idea what you’re talking about," the Cheater says in response to an accusation. "My motives were pure."
            * When we deceive ourselves about our own motives, however, it becomes much _harder for others to prosecute these minor transgressions_
    * Modularity: _a part of a system to process information_. Modern psychologists believe that _there are hundred of these modularities._
        * Different parts might **violate each other**.
        * For self-deception, it's possible that we **maintain** a accurate set of beliefs **while keeping them hidden**.
6. Counterfeit reasons
    * **Rationalization**: They're _neither truths or lies_
        * Human will confabulate to **make sense of thing** instead of admitting that we don't know.
    * We habitually **accentuate and exaggerate our pretty, pro-social motives** and downplay our ugly, selfish ones.

## Hidden Motives in Everyday Life
1. Body language
    * **Has material consequences** => _Considered more honest than verbal language._
    * **Differentially expensive** make body language honest. Expensive to show a body language but even more expensive to lie.
    * Topics:
        * _Sex_: Showing interests in each other and sexual jealous.
        * _Politics_: To convey trust, loyalty
            * When we feel comfortable around others, we touch them and allow ourselves to be ched.
        * _Social status_:
            * _High-status people_ tend to have _more relaxed_ position, more open. While the low-status is opposite.
            * 2 kinds of status: **dominance** (by force) and **prestige** (by impression)
                * In dominance, eye contact is considered aggression. While in prestige, it is seen as a gift, to elevate that person.
2. Laughter
    * Laugh to show that you are _willing to play_. Your action is just for fun. Or laugh _to show everything is safe_.
    * Norms: The first is to **feint across the norm boundary**, but **then retreat** back to safety without actually violating it. Or step across the boundary, **violating the norm**, and then to **realize "It's safe** over here! Wheee!"
    * **Psychological Distance**: There are 2 variables on when we laugh. First is _the amount of pain_ and second is _distance_. We are more likely to laugh at strangers or someone "far" from us.
    * **Deniability**: To _explore the boundaries of norms_. Deny conviction because we really don't have a clear understanding of what our laughter means or why we find funny things funny
        > "If you want to tell people the truth, make them laugh; otherwise they'll kill you" - Oscar Wilde
3. Language
    * Is also **a way to have advantage over peers**.
    * Cost-benefit:
        * Listening: _cost little_ but have _large benefit_, we can learn from others.
        * Speaking:
            * Cost: _opportunity cost of monopolizing information_ and the _cost of acquiring information_ (have something to say)
            * Benefit: _Raising social status_ in the eyes of the listeners. And to prove to be a _potential leader or mate_.
        * Listeners want speakers to be able to _react upon what the conversation leads to_ rather than to the topic the speakers know about.
    * **Prestige**: Not only _by speaking_ but _by the act that respectful or impressive people is willing to talk to you_.
    * News: Extend the small conversation to larger one. And it's a form of gossiping.
    * Academic: Still a prestige game.
4. Consumption
    * Conspicuous consumption. Trying to **show off**.
    * We buy green product not only for environment but also to be seen as helpful. Signaling that "I'm willing to forgo luxury in order to help the planet"
    * Consumption also signals our **Loyalty, Being cool and Intelligence (Rubik cube)**. 
    * Advertising: Provide information or Showing promise or Lifestyle.

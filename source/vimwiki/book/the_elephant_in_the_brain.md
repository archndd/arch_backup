### Core idea
* We, human beings, are a species that's not only capable of acting on **hidden motives - we're designed to do it**
* Our brains are built to **act in our self-interest** while at the same time **trying hard not to appear selfish** in front of other people
* _The less we know of our own ugly motives, the easier it is to hide them from others_. **Self-deception** is therefore strategic, **a ploy our brains use to look good while behaving badly**
* **Approach by evolutionary psychology**, by looking from Darwinian perspective. Then looking at larger social levels.
* For more information: There's a Standford's course called Behavior Biology, which suggest the idea that all of our behavior deprived from our motives to pass our genes to our future generations

### Notation
* **"The elephant": refer to the ugly motives of ourselves**. Like the fact that we’re competitive social animals _fighting for power, status, and sex_; the fact that we’re sometimes _willing to lie and cheat to get ahead_; the fact that _we hide some of our motives_

## Why We Hide Our Motives
1. Animal Behavior
    * In some primates, ones help others to _build trust between them and expect to be helped in return_.
    * **Some species have altruistic behavior because of their own goods instead of "good for the species"**. They will have higher chance of surviving and reproducing their genes
2. Competition
    * _It is suggested that humans developed big brain because of the intra-species competition_. **We will lie to get the better of others while trying to detect lies.** That's why we need bigger brain to process more information.
    * Sex: **One of the reason why we compete is to reproduce our genes**. Like peacocks having heavy and colorful tails for the sake of reproduction but not survival.
    * Social status: **There are dominance and prestigious**. Though prestigious is not as competitive as dominance, _they are zero-sum game which explains why we sometimes envy of our close friend's success._
    * Politic: **The ability to gang up and fighting others to achieve high status**. Politic is the combination of betrayal, violence, backstabbing and wisdom, kind, charisma.
    * Each game requires two complementary skill sets: **the ability to evaluate potential partners** and **the ability to attract good partners**
        > Judge freely, and accept that you too will be judged.  

3. Norm
    * **Norms help us decide** what to do in a certain situation (fight or flight)
    * **Collective enforcement**, _the fear of the denial of a group_, is what keep norms in place.
    * **Weapons** plays an important role in this scenario. They **enable the weak to beat on the strong** without heavy injury.
    * **Gossiping** (sometimes to keep people from behaving badly) and Getting **reputation** from standing up to cheaters are two very important aspects to keeps things in order.
4. Cheating
    * It's our **fear of shame** that prompts us either _to refrain from cheating_, or _else to cover our tracks so others don't find out_.
    * _There are two dimensions to keeping a secret_: **how widely** it's known and **how openly** or commonly it's known
        * A secret _can be widely known_ without being openly known like the fact that the emperor is naked, everyone knows but they know if others have the same thought as theirs.
        * Some secrets need to be kept unfound. _What matters is how openly it's known_. Like if you cheat, the only things matter is whether the professor knows it or not even though other students know.
    * _Norm enforcement requires not only_ **detecting a norm violation** but also **prosecuting the violation**.
    * There are **four main forms** of cheating:
        * _Pretexts_ (excuses) make prosecution more difficult. A pretext doesn't need to fool everyone, it simply needs to be plausible enough to make people worry that other people might believe it.
        * _Discreet communication_ to get away with something by preventing the message from becoming common knowledge.
        * _Skirting_ norms because real norms have many gray areas. Thus, some will try to take advantage of this.
        * _Minor sins_. **We’re selfish**. Not irredeemably selfish, **just slightly more** than our highest standards of behavior demand. We cloak our actions in justifications that appeal to what's best for everyone though these actions benefit us.
    *  If norms are supposed to discourage competition, then why do we still need big brains? A plausible answer is that **our norms are only partially enforced, so we need big brains to figure out how to cheat**.
